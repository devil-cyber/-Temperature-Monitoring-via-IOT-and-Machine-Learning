############ Hardware Requirment ############

We need the following components to build the whole project:
Bolt WiFi module
LM35 Temperature sensor
3Jumper wires ( Male to Female ) and 2simple connecting wires(for buzzer)
USB cable ( mobile charger can also be used )
Power Source ( power bank can also be used )
Bread Board





#############    Hardware configuration  ################




First, we will connect the Bolt Wifi module to LM35 temperature sensor through jumper wires.
LM35 has 3 pins, namely VCC, output, GND. So, we'll connect it with Bolt Wifi Module as follows:
VCC pin of the LM35 is connected to 5v of the Bolt Wiﬁ module.(The brown wire)
Output pin (middleone)is connected to A0 (Analog input pin) of the Bolt Wiﬁ module.(The red wire)
GND pinLM35 is connected to the GND.(The orange wire)
To connect the Buzzer, we'll use simple connecting wires, and connect as follows:
The negative pin(small one) is connected with the GND along with the LM35.
The Positive pin(large pin) is connected to the pin '1' (GPIO).



###################### Software configuration ########################################


We'll be using VMware Ubuntu device on our PC(Windows). You can Download the Virtual Box and Ubuntu Server.

Type the below command in terminal to install boltiot python library.
(sudo pip3 install boltiot)



To get bolt API key and device ID, go to Bolt cloud and click in API section you will get API key.
